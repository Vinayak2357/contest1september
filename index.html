            <h3>General:</h3>
            <p>The Hague is a city and municipality of the Netherlands, situated on the west coast facing the North Sea. 
                The Hague is the capital of the province of South Holland, and the city hosts both the International Court 
                of Justice and the International Criminal Court. The Hague is the country's administrative centre and its 
                seat of government, and while the official capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam, The Hague has been 
                described as the country's de facto capital. With a population of over half a million, it is the 
                third-largest city in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The Hague is the core municipality 
                of the Greater The Hague urban area, which comprises the city itself and its suburban municipalities, 
                containing over 800,000 people, making it the third-largest urban area in the Netherlands.</p>

            <h3>Demographics:</h3>
            <p>As of 1 January 2021, The Hague counts 549,163 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in
              the Netherlands. Between 1800 and 1960, the city saw considerable growth from 40,000 in 1800 to 
              200,000 in 1900 and eventually 600,000 in 1960. The growth following 1900 was partially caused by
               the housing act of 1901, which stimulated the expansion of cities such as The Hague. In the 
               period between 1960 and 1980, The Hague saw a shrinkage from 600,000 to 440,000 inhabitants, 
               caused mostly by spatial policy, demographic processes, and lack of space. After several 
               annexations and housing constructions, The Hague has since grown again, celebrating its 
               500,000th inhabitant in 2011. The municipality expects the growth to continue to just over 
               600,000 inhabitants by 2030.</p>       
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Other:</h3>
            <p>The Hague is the seat of the Cabinet, the States General, the Supreme Court, and the Council of 
                State of the Netherlands, but the city is not the constitutional capital, which is Amsterdam. King
                 Willem-Alexander lives in the Huis ten Bosch and works at the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague, 
                 together with Queen MÃ¡xima. Most foreign embassies in the Netherlands are in the city. The Hague 
                 is also home to the headquarters of many Dutch companies, with Shell having major offices in the 
                 city as well. The Royal Library of the Netherlands is located there as well.</p>

            <p>A really lovely beach resort as well as a city. There are many interesting stores and extremely
                 attractive streets in the Central neighbourhood. The approximate one-hour walk to the beach area
                  passes through Westbroekpark, a stunning park. To go to the seashore area, you may alternatively
                   use a tram, which takes around 10 minutes.Den Haag is a great city, not only because of its 
                   international standing, having for example, two international Courts (Justice and Arbitration),
                    but its architecture is great and so are its people. It has beautiful streets, buildings, parks
                     and way of life. It's a great city to visit. We have only been there briefly, once, but we 
                     loved it.</p>

            <p>Nice city, plenty of museums, excellent restaurants, and Scheveningen's beach is only 15 minutes 
                away. Large Christmas market with a wide selection of decorations, gifts, and other items besides
                 food and beverages. I heartily recommend visiting this location since it is filled with historic
                  structures that are well-kept and pleasant to gaze at a tiny, traditional city where you may 
                  stroll about, have coffee, and shop. If you have a car, it is preferable to park it privately 
                  because it is less expensive than on the street.

            <p>Den Haag is a lovely city with many historic architectural structures with a mediaeval flair and 
                paved streets. There are so many places/monuments to see in the city that it would take at least
                 a day to see them all. I thought it to be a pretty tranquil city, especially when contrasted to
                  Amsterdam, which is highly crowded. Den Haag is without a doubt one of my favourite cities in
                   Amsterdam and Europe. A must-see if you're in the Netherlands.
